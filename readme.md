# Bookshelf

## Introduction

Bookshelf is an online bookstore system via which users do not need to blindly go to various places to find required books, they just simply go to Bookshelf and find it. The online bookstore system can not only reduce costs, save time, space, to bring convenience to everyone, but also promote the development of the logistics industry, serving three purposes, mutual benefit. Users can view its details, place an order and then the book is delivered to their address. Users can see their orders placed, their status (delivered date, order placed date), and rate/review their ordered products
